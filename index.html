                This page was inspired by a <a href="">tweet from Salma</a>.
                Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well, and
                accessible. But here we are. I'm trying my best.

            <h2>How does this work?</h2>
            <p>
                The key to a lot of this is leveraging using tables with a
                <code>role="presentation"</code> attribute to make decorated
                sections without css. If you view source on the page, you'll see
                that there are a LOT of tables. The table tag typically is used
                to display tabular data and should NOT be used as a layout
                method. However, since I am not allowed to use CSS, I am pretty
                much exclusively relying on tables for this purpose. The
                presentation role tells the browser to not expose the table and
                its tabluar children in the accessibility tree. This will make
                it easier to navigate for assistive technology. <br /><br />
                I'm also leveraging some deprecated HTML elements from HTML 3.2
                that you should never use. In order to be "compliant", I've
                added the HTML 3.2 doctype at the top of the page: <br />
                <code
                    >&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2
                    Final//EN"&gt;</code
                ><br />
                This helps give a hint to the browser that we are going to use
                some older stuff. <br /><br />
                HOWEVER, I'm also using some newer things such as
                <code>details/summary, section, main, header</code>, and
                <code>footer</code>. So I'm just making a mess of my doctype and
                what I should be actually using!
